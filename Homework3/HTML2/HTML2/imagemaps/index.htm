<p>There is an image map on this page. You use an graphics file as an image
map.
<p>There are hot areas on the image map that the user can click on. Typically,
the hot areas connect to other pages.
<p>The image map itself has a Cartesian coordinate system on top of it.
So each point on the image map can be defined by two
<br>points - an x axis coordinate and a y axis coordinate. The size of
the image map on the next page is 400 by 250. So the
<br>upper-left corner of the image map is the point 0,0; the lower-right
corner is the point 400,250; the upper right corner is the
<br>point 400,0; and the lower left corner is the point 0,250.
<p>In order to determine where the hot areas should be, you have to guess
the coordinates of a rectangle that defines that area.
<br>You need to estimate the location of the upper left and lower right
corners of the rectangle.
<p>Try out the image map on this page. Look at the code&nbsp; to see how
the image map was implemented.
<p>The MAP container is used to define an imagemap. Its one attribute is
NAME, which is set to "boston" in this case.
<p>Within the MAP container are three AREA commands. The AREA command is
used to define a region of the map that will be a hot area. There are three
attributes for the AREA command. The SHAPE attribute is set to RECT, since
a rectangular region is being defined. The HREF attribute is set to the
web address or name of the file that the hot area will link to. The COORDS
attribute contains four numbers separated by commas. The first two numbers
define the x and y coordinates of the upper left corner of the rectangle.
The last two numbers define the x and y coordinates of the lower right
corner of the rectangle.
<p>The IMG command that includes the graphic file must have one more attribute
set. The USEMAP attribute must be set to the name of the map, in this case
"#boston".
<p>After you see how this image map works, modify the HTML file so that
there are three additional hot areas that take you to files named Gardner.htm,
Library.htm, and MeetingHouse.htm. These files are already on your disk.
